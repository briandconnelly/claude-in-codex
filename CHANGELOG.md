# Changelog

All notable changes to `cc-plugin-codex` will be documented in this file.

This project uses pre-1.0 semantic versioning. Minor versions may change the
agent-visible MCP surface; patch versions are reserved for compatible fixes.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-06-06

- Added prompt-injection guardrails that tell Claude to treat reviewed diffs,
  evidence, context, and project files as untrusted data.
- Promoted `--no-session-persistence` to a fail-closed Claude CLI contract flag
  so sensitive review sessions are not silently persisted.
- Added advisory detection for workspace Claude Code hook settings and surfaced
  hook posture in status, dry-run, paid result metadata, and background jobs.
- Clarified security documentation: the plugin withholds Bash/write tools, but
  Claude Code hooks can run outside the tool allowlist unless `config_mode=bare`
  is used.
- Bumped the agent-visible schema fingerprint to `cc-plugin-codex/0.1/schema-13`.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-06-06

- Added PyPI-facing package metadata, long description, project links, and
  classifiers.
- Added changelog and security policy documentation.
- Added a Trusted Publishing workflow for tag-triggered PyPI releases.
- Clarified the relationship between the Codex plugin install path and the PyPI
  server package.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-06-05

- Added explicit Claude CLI compatibility documentation and release lockstep
  guidance.
- Exposed structured readiness, review, adversarial review, second-opinion, and
  background job tools for Codex.
- Added local quality gates for linting, formatting, type checking, tests, and
  coverage.
